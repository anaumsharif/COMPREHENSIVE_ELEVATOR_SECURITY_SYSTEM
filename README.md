The COMPREHENSIVE_ELEVATOR_SECURITY_SYSTEM project is a sophisticated elevator security solution that employs Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks (LRCN) to analyze video footage captured inside elevator cabins. This system aims to enhance elevator safety and security by detecting and responding to various security threats or unusual behaviors in real-time.

Project Objectives
Elevators are critical spaces where security incidents can occur, including unauthorized access, vandalism, or emergencies
### Project Overview

The **COMPREHENSIVE_ELEVATOR_SECURITY_SYSTEM** aims to improve elevator safety and security by leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically LRCN, to analyze video streams captured inside elevators. The system can detect and alert on various security threats or unusual behaviors, enhancing the overall safety measures in elevator environments.

### Key Components and Functionality

- **Video Analysis**:
  - Utilizes LRCN to analyze video sequences captured inside elevator cabins.
  - Processes video frames to detect specific events or behaviors indicative of security threats.

- **Threat Detection**:
  - Detects suspicious activities such as unauthorized access, vandalism, or emergency situations within elevators.

- **Real-time Monitoring**:
  - Provides real-time monitoring of elevator cabins, allowing immediate response to security incidents.

### Prerequisites

Before running the system, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.x recommended)
- Required Python libraries (install using `pip`):
  - `tensorflow` for deep learning operations
